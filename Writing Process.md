1. What are my writing habits? Typically, when I am writing, I do a good job about not breaking my train of thought. Once I am thinking well and writing well, I find it relatively easy to stay focused. However, it can be sometimes difficult to get to that point. Often times, I find myself needing the circumstances -- mostly quiet room, coffee within reach, etc -- to be right for my writing to be the best it can be. I'll start by actually creating an outline or at least scribbling down some main points. After that, I usually write the paper chronoligically, however, sometimes starting with paragraphs in the middle. 

2. How might they improve? One thing that I could certainly work on is consistency. I would love to get to the point where I write a little bit on a regular basis rather than a lot rarely. I am sure this would tremendously help my skill to grow. Also, it would help to stay relatively consistent with my writing choices and topic selection that way I can easily recaLl

One Improvement: Write regularly
One Strength: Staying focused
