I really enjoyed the opportunity to write and create a blog. In the ever-changing writing market, freelance writing is growing so it was a useful skill to learn. Although I had used wordpress once before in high school, this assignment involved a much larger understanding of the program, which was a helpful lesson. If nothing else, it certainly refreshed my memory. 

One thing that was uncertain was how we were to cite sources. I didn't see any information about that part so I just included the links at the bottom. Also, there are still a great deals of tools on wordpress and github that I don't fully understand. Continuing this form fo exposure to the programs would be helpful in that area. 

This assignment was very practical and helpful. I especially enjoyed the fact that we could use our own topic instead of being given one. It would have difficult to spend time extensively researching an uninteresting topic.
