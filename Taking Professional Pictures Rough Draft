#Learning to Take Professional Pictures
***

## 1. Become Acquainted with a Camera 
There are several features to a professional Camera that make it notoriously more difficult to use than the easy phone application. However, the same features that complicate the device also allow it to be a more effective tool.

## 2. Technical Information

ISO stands for International Standards Organization, the association that standardizes sensitivity technology for cameras. Likewise, the setting on the camera called ISO regulates how sensitive the device is to the light that enters the lense. By setting the ISO number lower, the lense becomes less sensitive, and the picture will be darker. In the same way, setting the ISO too high will result in a very bright photo. Ideally, each student should find the right setting for each situation. Below are a few common situations to help troubleshooting: 
### A. Darker Lighting (Cloudy days, Nighttime, Inside Dark Rooms, etc): 100-200 ISO
### B. Medium Lighting (Partly Cloudy, Brighter Rooms): 200-300 ISO
### C. Bright Lighting (Sunny days): 300-400 ISO
On a Cannon camera, the ISO changes with the same scroll
