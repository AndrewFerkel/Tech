# Study Smarter, Not Harder

## Make It Stick Extra Credit

Relative to my knowledge, AP United States History was indisputably the hardest course that I have ever taken. I would not wish it one anyone; and yet, like most crucibles of life, it inspired a new appreci ation within me. This time, that appreciation was focused towards perfecting learning. So, now, in a desperate attempt to sleep more than five hours, I appreciate informative segments such as this one. With that in mind, the writing inspired several thoughts. 
	
For a long time, I have been fascinated with the notion that I learn better when I am interested in a subject. At another time, I have simply resigned the cause for this as an inherit benefit to appreciating knowledge, but now, due to articles such as this one, I am inclined to think that itâ€™s not that simple. As I read this, the authors perused more than seven various methods for effective learning, retrieval practice, spacing out studying, mixing up the problems, elaboration, generation, reflection, and calibration, just to name a few. Interesting enough, each of these study patterns are inherently derivative of an appreciation of the subject. For instance:
	
**Retrieval practice** would occur naturally in conversation if someone is fascinated by what they are learning.

**Elaboration** occurs as a byproduct of increased thought about a subject. Moreover, appreciation is a primarily filter for the subjects about which we think.

**Calibration** happens naturally to someone personally interested in learning about the subject just to learn about it. It only becomes a problem if the student does not want to learn and, as a result, studies the bare minimum to try and do well on the test. 

Much of this is both self-explanatory and overly-optimistic. After all, no one will always appreciate the subjects about which they are learning. As a result, I have made several plans based on this information to account for the times that I simply do not want to study (every other day unfortunately). Last semester, I made an effort to review information on a weekly or biweekly basis, but I studied in a very ineffective manner. So this semester, I hope to take those same habits and apply them to better studying habits, habits that incorporate mentalities such as elaboration, generation, and reflection. By second goal is straightforward, annoy my roommate. This may sound odd, but if I can incorporate the things that I am learning into my conversation, I will, by design, be practicing many of these habits. All the while, I will be annoying my roommate. With this in mind, I hope to be more successful with my use of time through these study habits.
