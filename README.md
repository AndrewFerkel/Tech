#Typical Writing Structure
##Andrew Ferkel

I typically begin the process of writing a paper the moment I first hear the prompt by simply thinking about it. Often times, the prompt does not demonstrate a common issue, but if it does, this step simplifies. After all, I am more liable to already have an opinion. Once I have invested some thought towards the subject, I reflect on my opinions and begin to arrange them into a rough outline. 

Once I have some form of structure to my thoughts, I begin the actual process of writing. Typically, I record my thoughts chronologically, writing the introduction first, then the body paragraphs, and ending with the conclusion. If my thoughts are particularly sporadic, I digress into writing one of the body paragraphs first, usually whichever one is the easiest. Then, I move systematically throughout the points that work in conjunction with the one I already explained. The most fundamental step for me to write though, is truthfully making the time for it.

J.K. Rowling explains this conundrum, [The funny things is that, although writing has been my job for several years now, I still have to fight for the time in which to do it.] (https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/writing-inspiration)

Many times, I will methodically build my points even before having the quotes to support them. Then, at the end, I will return to the point, find a dynamic C.S. Lewis quote, and add it.

Even if the quote has nothing to do with the subject, *everyone* loves a good **C.S Lewis** quote:

<“To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”>

And then I turn the essay into the teacher.
